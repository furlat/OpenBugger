OpenBugger

OpenBugger is a tool for injecting various types of bugs into Python scripts in order to test the robustness of your code and practice debugging skills. It comes with a library of bug injection methods for different severity levels and error types, such as syntax errors, logic errors, and runtime errors.

## ONGOING LIBCST REFACTOR
